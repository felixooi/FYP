Model Selection Justification:
==============================
Selected Model: XGBoost

Selection Criteria:
- Primary Metric: Recall = 0.9820
- Secondary Metric: F1_Score = 0.9847

Performance Summary:
- Accuracy: 0.9847
- Precision: 0.9874
- Recall: 0.9820
- F1-Score: 0.9847
- ROC-AUC: 0.9987

Rationale:
XGBoost achieved the highest Recall score, which is critical 
for attrition prediction as missing at-risk employees is costlier than false positives.
The model also demonstrates strong performance across other metrics, making it 
suitable for production deployment.
